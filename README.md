# home-monitoring-system
We have built a smart door sensing device using Arduino which can easily sense and detect a person coming near the door in certain detection distance and will ring the buzzer in the given range. Our system will also send an intruder alert to a connected mobile phone via Bluetooth, which can make the person alert that someone is there at his\her place.
